"""Model registry + per-call provider routing.

``MODEL_SPECS`` is the single source of truth for: what we ship to the
Council UI, which OpenRouter slug each Claude model maps to, and which
Anthropic-only features each model tolerates. ``get_provider(model)``
picks the backend per call so the user can flip an agent's model in the
Council UI and have requests for that agent — and only that agent —
route differently.
